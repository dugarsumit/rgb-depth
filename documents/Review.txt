1. Add scale2 and scale3 models.
2. Assume #chan also implies the number of conv layers in a block.
3. upsample is still pendding, by nn.ConvTanspose2d?
4. Add forward
5. The initial dimensions of scales have been calculated. But mismatching takes place in scale3

1. finish the model part and forward pass
2. remove model_alt.py
3. scale1: tune strides the first two conv layers to fit dimensions
4. use UpsamplingBilinear2d for upsampling, dimensions explicitly coded
5. scale3: sizes are different from the paper and the 2.9 is added after 3.3(unclear to me)
6. scale2 will be trained at first and then scale3. This part not adapted yet.
