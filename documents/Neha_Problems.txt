1. Downloading vgg_16:
    Since the pretrained weight file is a big one, you may have trouble downloading it in one go.
    Try on your terminal:
        wget https://download.pytorch.org/models/vgg16-397923af.pth     #You can find this url in vgg.py file
        mv vgg16-397923af.pth ~/.torch/models/
2. torchsample:
    We can directly augment tensor-data with the torchsample library - https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample
    1. Download using git clone https://github.com/ncullen93/torchsample.git
    2. activate your virtualenv
    3. cd torchssample
    4. python setup.py build
    5. python setup.py install
    6. extract the .EGG file in <virtual env>/lib/python3.5/site-packages
    7. copy over the torchsample folder to <virtual env>/lib/python3.5/site-packages
