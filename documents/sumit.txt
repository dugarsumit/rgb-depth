scipy is not able to read .mat files so I had to use h5py

depth data = float32
rgb = uint8


segmentation image data have followings keys: 
#refs#
#subsystem#
accelData
depths
images
instances
labels
names
namesToIds
rawDepthFilenames
rawDepths
rawRgbFilenames
sceneTypes
scenes

We need to use python 3.5 because pickle is not working properly with python 2.7


test data : dataset_rgb2depth_train_part13_of_14
validation data : dataset_rgb2depth_train_part14_of_14
